**Intro:**

Welcome to Ultrabell! *Enjoy your stay, as **Mario's Kingdom is endless!***

What if back in Early 1996, Super Mario 64 took a different path,
fixing / reimplementing broken gameplay mechanics, giving Luigi his rightful return, adding new enemies / levels, and other unique things?
Ultrabell is the answer to that question.

Taking place a few months before E3 1996, Ultrabell is Mario and Luigi's newest adventure through vast riversides, sky fortresses,
and even castle labyrinths set up to trap the Plumbers by the evil King Koopa!

I'm aiming to faithfully recreate beta mechanics / content, fix (a few) bugs, and even add in my own custom content including (a) brand new level(s) and other various things!

I couldn't make this hack without them!

I can't wait to add even more things as time goes on, and I learn even more about my favorite game of all time.
Have fun! :3
