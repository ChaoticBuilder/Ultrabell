MARIO 1995: ULTRABELL

*This isn't your ordinary SM64 Development build. There are secrets hidden within...*

INTRO:
Welcome to Ultrabell! One of the very many hacks of SM64 that aim to recreate a beta build of the game.
Ultrabell is a hack that takes place in the December 1995 - January 1996 development timeline, a real development phase with my own fake name I created.
it's in-between the demos shown off at Shoshinkai, (later known as Space World) and E3 1996.

I've made several changes that recreate beta mechanics / content, fix (a few) bugs, add in my own custom content including brand new levels, and other various things!

CREDITS:
spongelover6996 on Discord for the Time Attack idea (which hasn't been added yet, will do that eventually, I'm just lazy tbh)

xbciom also on Discord for the FOV shake in "intense" levels, other level ideas, and music, (that will also be added later, except for the fov shake, that's already added)

SMF128: Realistic Mode and also for just existing tbh bro's based asf

iman/eman/#1 hater of 3 and w/whatever tf else this mf goes by: Possibly a future lapping feature, idk yet tbh

Kaze Emanuar, for making amazing videos on SM64 optimizations, which taught me more about the game!

And finally, Credits to the amazing people behind the [HackerSM64](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64) Repo! I couldn't make this hack without them!

I've been working super hard to make this my version of a definitive version of SM64, a sort of "what if, the game wasn't rushed, and they didn't scrap the beta art style?"

I can't wait to add even more things as time goes on, and I learn even more about my favorite game of all time.
Have fun! :3
