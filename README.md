MARIO 1995: ULTRABELL

*This isn't your ordinary SM64 Development build. There are secrets hidden within...*

INTRO:
Welcome to Ultrabell! *Enjoy your stay, as **Mario's Kingdom is endless!***

Ultrabell is one of the very many hacks of SM64 that aim to recreate a beta build of the game.
It takes place in-between the demos shown off at Shoshinkai, (later known as Space World) and E3 1996. (Dec '95 - Jan '96)

I've made several changes that recreate beta mechanics / content, fix (a few) bugs, add in my own custom content including brand new levels, and other various things!

CREDITS:
spongelover6996/Tophatman for the Time Attack idea (which hasn't been added yet, will do that eventually, I'm just lazy tbh)

xbciom for the FOV shake in "intense" levels, other level ideas, and music, (that will also be added later, except for the fov shake, that's already added)

supermariofurry/SMF128: and for bro just existing tbh bro's based asf

imann0731/eman/3 and w hater/whatever this mf goes by: Possibly a future lapping feature, idk yet tbh

Amitabhtechz (Left the community): For helping me add Gigaleak .sou / .hms files and convert them! (Especially the 2D Stars, I've wanted to add them for a while lol!)

the voices in my head: Shoshinkai and Realistic mode, mario having hallucinations every 15 mins, (real thing btw, go look at hud.c) mario permadrowning, and a few other things

stalechilibeans, iProgramInCpp, and the other people who worked on TPP, for Animations & *a few* Assets, comparing as a reference for my own beta content, and other miscellaneous things!

Kaze Emanuar, for making amazing videos on SM64 optimizations, which taught me more about the game!

And finally, Credits to the amazing people behind the [HackerSM64](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64) Repo! I couldn't make this hack without them!

I've been working super hard to make this my version of a definitive version of SM64, a sort of "what if, the game wasn't rushed, and they didn't scrap the beta art style?"

I can't wait to add even more things as time goes on, and I learn even more about my favorite game of all time.
Have fun! :3
