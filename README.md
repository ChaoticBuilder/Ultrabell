MARIO 1995: ULTRABELL
Credit to HackerSM64 for the original Repo.

*This isn't your ordinary E3 Recreation...*

Welcome to UltraBell! One of the very many hacks of SM64 that aim to recreate development versions of SM64.
Ultrabell is a hack that's around the December 1995 - January 1996 timeline, a real development phase with a fake name that's supposed to be between Ultra Mario Brothers and the final game.

Currently, I haven't added any levels yet, but I've made several changes that recreate beta mechanics / content, fix bugs, add in my own custom content, and other various things.

You should really check it out despite me not having much to offer at this phase!

(also, btw, if you notice any mistakes between the repo and the bps patch, please let me know, as I'm copying over the files by hand and can make mistakes.)
