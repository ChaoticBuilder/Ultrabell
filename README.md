MARIO 1995: ULTRABELL

*This isn't your ordinary E3 build. There are secrets hidden within...*

INTRO:
Welcome to UltraBell! One of the very many hacks of SM64 that aim to recreate development versions of the game.
Ultrabell is a hack that's in the December 1995 - January 1996 development timeline, a real development phase with a fake name.
it's in-between the demos shown off at Shoshinkai, (later known as Space World) and the final game.

Currently, I haven't added any levels yet, but I've made several changes that recreate beta mechanics / content, fix (a few) bugs, add in my own custom content, and other various things.
You should really check it out despite that though! I've added quite a bit of stuff!

(Also, I'm copying over files by hand, so I'll try to make sure the repo is consistent with the hack itself, but I'll likely make a lot of mistakes, I'll try to fix those.)
