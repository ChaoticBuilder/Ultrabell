MARIO 1995: ULTRABELL

*This isn't your ordinary E3 build. There are secrets hidden within...*

INTRO:
Welcome to UltraBell! One of the very many hacks of SM64 that aim to recreate development versions of the game.
Ultrabell is a hack that's in the December 1995 - January 1996 development timeline, a real development phase with a fake name, it's between the demos shown off at Shoshinkai, (later known as Space World) and the final game.

Currently, I haven't added any levels yet, but I've made several changes that recreate beta mechanics / content, fix (a few) bugs, add in my own custom content, and other various things.

You should really check it out despite that though! I've added quite a bit of stuff!

(also, btw, if you notice any mistakes between the repo and the bps patch, please let me know, as I'm copying over the files by hand and can make mistakes.)
