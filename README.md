**Intro:**

Welcome to Ultrabell! *Enjoy your stay, as **His Kingdom is endless!***

What if back in Early 1996, Super Mario 64 took a different path, fixing / reimplementing broken gameplay mechanics,
re-coding Luigi back into the game, new unique enemies / levels, and other various things?

Ultrabell is my answer to that question.

In this "Development Build" made a few months before E3, journey through vast Riversides, Sky Fortresses,
and even Castle labyrinths set up to trap the Plumbers by the evil King Koopa!

The Mario Brothers need your help after all!
