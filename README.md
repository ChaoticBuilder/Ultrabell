INTRO:
Welcome to Ultrabell! *Enjoy your stay, as **Mario's Kingdom is endless!***

What if back in Early 1996, Super Mario 64 took a different path, opting to maintain the Beta artstyle, and improve on what they already had?
Ultrabell is my answer to that question.

This hack is one of many others that aim to recreate a beta build of the game,
taking place in-between the demos shown off at Shoshinkai, (later known as Space World) and E3 1996. (Dec '95 - Jan '96)

I'm aiming to faithfully recreate beta mechanics / content, fix (a few) bugs, and even add in my own custom content including (a) brand new level(s) and other various things!

CREDITS:
spongelover6996/Tophatman: The Time Attack idea

supermariofurry/SMF128: for just existing tbh bro's based asf

imann0731/iman: Possibly a future lapping feature, idk yet tbh

Amitabhtechz (Left the community): For helping me add Gigaleak .sou / .hms files and convert them! (Especially the 2D Stars, I've wanted to add them for a while lol!)

stalechilibeans, iProgramInCpp, and the other people who worked on TPP: Animations & *a few* Assets, comparing as a reference for my own beta content, and other miscellaneous things,

Kaze Emanuar: making amazing videos on SM64 optimizations, which taught me more about the game!

And finally, Credits to the amazing people behind the [HackerSM64](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64) Repo! I couldn't make this hack without them!

I can't wait to add even more things as time goes on, and I learn even more about my favorite game of all time.
Have fun! :3
